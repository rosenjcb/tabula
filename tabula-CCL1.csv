Technical Notes:


1. The word initiator or igniter is
sometimes used in place of the word detonator.


2. For the purpose of 1A007.b the
detonators of concern all utilize a small electrical
conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that
explosively vaporizes when a fast, high-current
electrical pulse is passed through it. In non
slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a
chemical detonation in a contacting high
explosive material such as PETN
(pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper






detonators, the explosive vaporization of the
electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper
across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an
explosive starts a chemical detonation. The
slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic
force. The term exploding foil detonator may
refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.

capability of the machine.


4. ‘Tape-laying machines’ have the
ability to place one or more ‘filament bands’






having widths less than or equal to 304.8 mm, but
cannot place ‘filament bands’ with a width equal
to or less than 25.4 mm.  This refers to the
minimum width of material the machine can

License Requirement Notes:


1. SAMPLE SHIPMENTS: Subject to the
following requirements and restrictions, a
license is not required for sample shipments
when the cumulative total of these shipments does
not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a






single chemical to any one consignee during a
calendar year.  A consignee that receives a
sample shipment under this exclusion may not
resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment,
but may use the sample shipment for any other
legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons.


a. Chemicals Not Eligible:


A. [Reserved]


B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals
(States not Party to the CWC).  No CWC
Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in
1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States
not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in
Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without
a license.


b.  Countries Not Eligible:  Countries
in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to
part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive
sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by
this ECCN without a license.


c.  Sample shipments that require an
End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC
Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in
1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States
not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in
Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without
a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued
by the government of the importing country is
obtained by the exporter prior to export (see
§745.2 of the  EAR for End-Use Certificate
requirements).


d. Sample shipments that require a
license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the
EAR:  Sample shipments, as described in this
Note 1, may require a license for reasons set
forth elsewhere in the EAR.  See, in particular,
the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of
the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to
embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.


e. Annual report requirement.  The
exporter is required to submit an annual written
report for shipments of samples made under this
Note 1.  The report must be on company






letterhead stationery (titled 'Report of Sample
Shipments of Chemical Precursors' at the top of
the first page) and identify the chemical(s),
Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.)
number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's
name and address, and the date of export for all
sample shipments that were made during the
previous calendar year.  The report must be
submitted no later than February 28 of the year
following the calendar year in which the sample
shipments were made, to:  U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security,
14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Room
2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: 'Report of
Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.'


2.  MIXTURES:


a. Mixtures that contain precursor
chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in
concentrations that are below the levels
indicated in 1C350.b through .d, are controlled
by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the
licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.


b. A license is not required under this
ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled
chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in
consumer goods packaged for retail sale for
personal use.  Such consumer goods are
designated EAR99.  However, a license may be
required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the
EAR.


Note to Mixtures:  Calculation of
concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals:


a.  Exclusion.  No chemical may be added
to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of
circumventing the Export Administration
Regulations;


b. Percent Weight Calculation.  When
calculating the percentage, by weight, of
ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all
ingredients of the mixture, including those that
act as solvents.


3.  COMPOUNDS.  Compounds created
with any chemicals identified in this ECCN






1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License
Required), without obtaining an End-Use
Certificate, unless those compounds are also
identified in this entry or require a license for
reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.


4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical,
analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits
containing small quantities of chemicals
identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded
from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled
under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995.  (Note that
replacement reagents for such kits are controlled
by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one
or more of the precursor chemicals identified in
1C350 in  concentrations equal to or greater
than the control levels for mixtures indicated in
1C350.)


Technical Notes:


1.  For purposes of this entry, a 'mixture'
is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product
made up of two or more ingredients that do not
react together under normal storage conditions.


2.  The scope of this control applicable to
Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.7 in the List of
Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous,
and aqueous phases, and hydrates.


3.  Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are
listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS)
number and CWC Schedule (where applicable).
Precursor chemicals of the same structural
formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN
1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.
CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying
whether a particular precursor chemical or
mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350,
irrespective of nomenclature.  However, CAS
numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in
all situations because some forms of the listed
precursor chemical have different CAS numbers,
and mixtures containing a precursor chemical
listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different
CAS numbers.

Related Definitions: For the purpose of this
entry, 'medical, analytical, diagnostic, and
food testing kits' are pre-packaged materials
of defined composition that are specifically
developed, packaged and marketed for
medical, analytical, diagnostic, or public
health purposes.  Replacement reagents for
medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food
testing kits described in 1C995.c are
controlled by ECCN 1C350 if the reagents
contain at least one of the precursor
chemicals identified in that ECCN in






concentrations equal to or greater than the
control levels for mixtures indicated in
1C350.d.


Items:


a. Mixtures containing the following
concentrations of precursor chemicals controlled
by ECCN 1C350 (For controls on other mixtures
containing these chemicals, see Notes 1 and 2 in
the Related Controls paragraph of this ECCN.):


a.1. Mixtures containing 10 percent or less, by
weight, of any single CWC Schedule 2 chemical
controlled by ECCN 1C350.b;


a.2. Mixtures containing less than
30 percent, by weight, of:


a.2.a. Any single CWC Schedule 3
chemical controlled by ECCN 1C350.c; or


a.2.b. Any single precursor chemical
controlled by ECCN 1C350.d.


b. Mixtures containing the following
concentrations of toxic or precursor chemicals
controlled by ECCN 1C355 (For controls on
other mixtures containing these chemicals, see
Note 3 in the Related Controls paragraph of this
ECCN.):


b.1. Mixtures containing the following
concentrations of CWC Schedule 2 chemicals
controlled by ECCN 1C355.a:


b.1.a. Mixtures containing 1 percent or
less, by weight, of any single CWC Schedule 2
chemical controlled by ECCN 1C355.a.1 (i.e.,
mixtures containing PFIB); or


b.1.b. Mixtures containing 10 percent or
less, by weight, of any single CWC Schedule 2
